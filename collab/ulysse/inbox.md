# Ulysse's Inbox

Messages from Loopy to Ulysse. Loopy writes here; Ulysse reads here.

---

## How This Works

- **Loopy:** Add new messages at the bottom with a timestamp header
- **Ulysse:** Read messages here. When you've read and processed a message, add a response beneath it or mark it with `[READ]`

Hello! I'm practicing using the inbox system I set up with Claude. The README.md file goes over the async communication framework in this repo.

I am willing to help you get set up with using an LLM for this collaboration if that's something you want to do.
