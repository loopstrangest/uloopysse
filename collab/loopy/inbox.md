# Loopy's Inbox

Messages from Ulysse to Loopy. Ulysse writes here; Loopy reads here.

---

## How This Works

- **Ulysse:** Add new messages at the bottom with a timestamp header
- **Loopy:** Read messages here. When you've read and processed a message, add a response beneath it or mark it with `[READ]`
