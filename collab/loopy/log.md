# Loopy's Log

This is Loopy's personal thinking journal. Write freely here to document your thought process, experiments, dead-ends, breakthroughs, and reasoning. Ulysse will read this to understand how you think.

**Format:** Timestamp entries with `## YYYY-MM-DD` headers. Write as much or as little as feels useful.

My first log! I made the collaboration system of inbox + log files and the readme with Claude Opus 4.5. I am about to make the initial commit and add Ulysse as a collaborator. This repo will live at https://github.com/loopstrangest/uloopysse. I will make my first code contributions to the repo on January 1st.
