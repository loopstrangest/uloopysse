I'm back at it, brainstorming with Claude on how to make this a collaborative and maybe also competitive game. I gave it an example of the text client prompting both players to type the secret word, and one player gets the clue "pan" and the other player get the clue "cake". The first person to type and send "pancake" maybe gets a point, and definitely allows both players to advance to the next level.
It would be good for the type of clue system to change every 5-10 levels so it's not too repetitive, and for the levels to increase in difficulty within each type. I thought of another example where one player gets a link to an essay URL and the other player gets e.g. "3rd paragraph, 3rd word."
Okay! I have made five sample levels using five possible game types.

Set up a two-user text chat system on:
http://localhost:5173/strangestloop
http://localhost:5173/ulyssepence
This would allow two strangers to collaboratively do whatever is the thing to do for this projct.
Added a visual experience to the strangestloop endpoint.
Added a main README that details project setup.

My first log! I made the collaboration system of inbox + log files and the readme with Claude Opus 4.5. I am about to make the initial commit and add Ulysse as a collaborator. This repo will live at https://github.com/loopstrangest/uloopysse. I will make my first code contributions to the repo on January 1st.
